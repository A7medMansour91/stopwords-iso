Stopwords ISO
=======

The most comprehensive collection of stopwords for multiple languages
The collection follows the ISO 639-1 language code.

### Usage

You are free to use this collection any way you like. The collection is in JSON format.
It is only currently published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/stopwords-iso) and [bower](https://bower.io/).
I might include a [maven](http://search.maven.org) and other language packages in the future.

```js
// Node
const stopwords = require('stopwords-iso');
```

### Contributing

If you wish to remove or update some of the stopwords, please file an issue first before sending a PR on the repo of the specific language.

If you would like to add a stopword or a new set of stopwords,
please add them as a new text file on the repo of the corresponding language.
